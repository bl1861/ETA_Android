##Project-based Interview: Infection

#### Files:
* ```User.java```:  The model of user.
* ```Main.java```:  The class has main function. You should run Main to execute the program.
* ```Infection.java```: The class used to  start the Total Infection or Limited Infection.
* ```compile.sh```: The file help compile all the files.

####Implementation:
* Implement the infection algorithm. Starting from any given user, the entire connected component of the coaching graph containing that user should become infected.
* Implement a procedure for limited infection. You will not be penalized for interpreting the specification as you see fit. There are many design choices and tradeoffs, so be prepared to justify your decisions.

#### Tester:
* Compile: Compile with the command ```$./compile.sh```
* Total Infection: Run the program using the command ```$./Main total 100```.  The first argument is the type of infection(```total``` or ```limited```). The second argument is the number of  users.

* Limited Infection: Run the program using the command ```$./Main limited 100 10```.  The first argument is the type of infection(```total``` or ```limited```). The second argument is the number of  users. The third argument is limited number of infection.

####Note:
* I built the relation of users as directed graph. The directed edge is from Coach to Student. Basically, I use BFS to solve both problems.
*  In the problem of Limited Infection, my solution now is finding a component which has the closest number of nodes to the limited number but less than or equal to limited number. The searching process run in the increasing order of ```user.id```.  It's kind of brute-force approach.
* I am not sure if I correctly implement the solution, but I have tried to make one. The executions of both problems will print the relation of users and the infection's spread.
